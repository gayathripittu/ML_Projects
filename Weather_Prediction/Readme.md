# Weather Prediction Project

This project explores the domain of weather prediction using machine learning techniques. The primary aim is to accurately forecast weather conditions by addressing the challenges posed by an imbalanced dataset.

The process involved initial dataset preprocessing, featuring diverse weather parameters. Baseline models like Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes initially displayed suspiciously high accuracy, indicating potential data imbalance issues. To mitigate this, Oversampling and Undersampling techniques were applied, and a comparative analysis before and after their implementation provided critical insights. Despite data balancing efforts, Logistic Regression maintained accuracy, highlighting its robustness. 

The project highlighted the complexities and importance of addressing data imbalance in predictive modeling, especially in fields like weather forecasting where accuracy is paramount.The findings underscore the significance of choosing the right data balancing technique and its influence on model performance.
