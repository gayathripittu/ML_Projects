This project aims to create a Knowledge Graph (KG) for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) research, analyzing studies from 2013 to 2023. The core focus was to visualize connections between various ALS research publications on PubMed. The methodology involved data extraction and applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques for effective analysis. Despite facing challenges in relation extraction, the project employed innovative solutions to overcome these obstacles. The final KG, though not as comprehensive as initially intended, marks a significant step in structuring ALS research data. It highlights the preliminary nature of the graph and points towards future work aimed at refining the KG and enhancing its validation process. This research provides a foundation for more advanced explorations and contributes to the understanding of ALS research dynamics
