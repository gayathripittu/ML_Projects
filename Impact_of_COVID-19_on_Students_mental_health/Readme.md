# Impact of COVID-19 on Students' Mental Health: A Machine Learning Approach

The research explores the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on students' mental health, particularly in relation to the shift to online learning. It addresses the challenges of data imbalance in previous studies and aims to improve model accuracy. The study uses machine learning classifiers like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XG Boost, Artificial Neural Networks, and ADA Boost for analysis. Notably, it incorporates techniques like oversampling, undersampling, and SMOTE to balance the dataset, leading to enhanced predictive accuracy. This research significantly contributes to understanding the pandemic's impact on student mental health and emphasizes the importance of balanced data in machine learning models.
